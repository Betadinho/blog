TODO for minimal viable product:


	# 1 registration form validate against confirm password
	# 1 create and handle sessions (no session created on login yet)

	# 2 build visualisation for articles to be displayed
	# 2 Add 1 Row with 3 columns to index.php to fill with Collections containing articles pulled from db
	# 2 make crud

	# 3 logout function and specific changes to displayed components like nav bar (add logout button, remove login/register for example)

	# 2 add form validation everywhere: emails, passwords
	# 2 validate, check for empty and clean form input with trim()

	# 2 make login/registration/posts in general go trough ajax
		- never again get redirected for no reason!





	# 4 get working side bar with Top, hot, recent etc.

	# 4 in nav.php -> mobile-links sidenav ul:
	-	remove login/register modals or find a way to implement them for mobile
	-	if not fixable, find new way for mobile users to login (build login/register sites)
